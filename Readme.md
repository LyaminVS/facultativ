# This is a single file, added to the new branch forked from master branch to demonstrate pull request operations.  

In this pull request we are adding new file and are going to discuss it's content.
Corresponding pull request will add the Readme.md file to master branch, once the pull request is resolved and suggested changes merged with master branch.  

# **Thus I suggest closing/decliining this pull request upon testing all related github fearutes!!!!**  
This way no modifications to master branch would be perfomed.
For the upcoming code reviews I suggest using new branch froked from the initial commit to create pull request from master to _new_review_branch_name (substitute this name with anythng you like, please prefer reasonabe name).
Upon finshing the review and closing the pull request the merge will fast-forward to actual master branch state and no additional operations would be required.
